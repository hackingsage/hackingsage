# 👋 Hi, I’m Arul Tripathi — aka hackingsage

## 🔭 What I'm All About  
I build things from the ground up from low-level OS kernels to high-level ML and simulation systems.  
I believe in deeply understanding systems mathematics, algorithms, hardware, and abstractions and then building clean, working solutions that reflect that understanding.

## 🌟 Selected Projects  

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ArulOS** | A complete 32-bit x86 operating system written in **C + Assembly**. Includes a custom shell, filesystem, text editor, calculator, command history, and tab-completion. Boots via GRUB. A deep dive into OS internals and low-level design. |
| **Schrodinger-PINN** | A Physics-Informed Neural Network that solves the **Schrödinger equation** by embedding PDE constraints inside the loss function. Explores the intersection of mathematical physics and ML. |
| **Neural-Network-lib** | A minimal deep-learning framework built entirely with **NumPy** — manual forward/backward propagation, gradients, activations, and optimization loops. A fundamentals-first study of neural networks. |
| **Classifier** | A custom ML classifier built fully from scratch: preprocessing → model → training → evaluation. Focuses on understanding model behavior beyond black-box ML frameworks. |
| **Quant-Trading-Simulator** | A multi-component quantitative trading simulation system: **C++ matching engine**, market-making bot, Node.js data bridge, and a React dashboard. Demonstrates simulation engineering and multi-language system design. |
| **CSES Problem Set** | A structured set of solutions to the **CSES Problem Set**. Strengthens algorithms, data structures, complexity analysis, and competitive-programming thought foundational for systems, ML, and quant work. |
| **AI Powered Code Review** | A **local, production-oriented AI-assisted code review tool** integrated into **VS Code**. Combines deterministic **AST-based static analysis** with optional **AI explanations and safe, human-in-the-loop fixes**. Designed to be fast, offline, and conservative AI never auto-modifies code. Focuses on security, performance, logic, complexity, and maintainability. |
